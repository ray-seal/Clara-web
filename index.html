        <h2>Where Mental Health Matters.</h2>
    <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Your mental health is our priority. If you are in <u>CRISIS</u> right now please contact the emergency services.</p>

        <p>
            At Clara, we believe that looking after your mental health is just as important as caring for your physical well-being. According to the World Health Organization, one in four people will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. In the UK alone, approximately 1 in 6 adults experience a common mental health problem, such as anxiety or depression, in any given week.<br><br>
            Prioritizing your mental health can improve your quality of life, relationships, and productivity. We encourage you to explore our resources and support options. Remember, you are not aloneâ€”help is available, and reaching out is a sign of strength.
